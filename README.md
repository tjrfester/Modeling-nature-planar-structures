Planar structures are among the structures I had the biggest difficulties when trying to model them. Finally I came up with an approach, where I derive position and normals of some 
flat sphere from some anchoring points (located on splines which in turn are anchored by other anchoring points). This approach is not perfect, but it works as long as 
structures are not too big or complex. Setting a border for these planar structures is (in my experience) only possible by cutting them using some predefined object. Feel very
encouraged to come up with better solutions... 
The first image exemplifies my basic approach: I am starting to the left with four different points, defining 4 different splines. These splines provide anchoring positions and inclinations for 
defining positions and normals of all the flat white spheres arranged within the rectangle in the middle panel. To the right these flat elements are fused into a blob.

If you want to create planar shapes for larger areas, you can fuse such rectangular patches as demonstrated with the following example.

For obtaining a specific shape it is possible to cut a respective shape off the white sheet as here

Given the right colour, this might be a small petal

Using the nervature of leaves for anchoring, it is also possible to model leaves. Currently I only achieved this with smaller leaves like here.

In an extension of the approach from above I modeled a beech leaf

Above is my simple version with lateral veins somehow printed on top:

And this is a more complex solution with lateral leaf veins guiding the construction of leaf blades - have a look at my respective video on youtube.
